The project was initiated with the purpose of designing a back-end database to store and manipulate the information on halls, rooms, students and employees and to develop a front-end application to enable access to the stakeholders at different levels according to their interest and responsibilities of halls (hostel) in a university.

This project was carried out as a part of Database Systems course that I followed in my 4th semester. There were total of 4 contributors to this project. 

I was mainly responsible for implementing and testing all the functionality, database management, interfaces related to the view given to an employee of this Hall Management System.
